# Welcome to LuminolBot!
LuminolBot is a general purpose Discord Bot that has various features from ciphers, fetching of posts, translation of languages, playing music from Youtube etc.

This is a side project that I am working on out of interest in learning JavaScript and Node.js, thus feedback is much appreciated.

## Inviting the bot
To use the bot, you have to invite the bot to a Discord server.

Do bear in mind, to invite the bot you need to have the 'Manage Server' permission in the server you want to invite to.
